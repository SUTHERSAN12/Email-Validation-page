# Email-Validation-page

Email validation in JavaScript is the process of ensuring that an email address entered by the user is in the correct format and is a valid email address or not. This is typically done on the client side using JavaScript before the form is submitted to the server.

I created Email validation site using HTML, CSS and javascript with special effects.
